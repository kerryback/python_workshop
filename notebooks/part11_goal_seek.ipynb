YTM is the internal rate of return of a bond, considering all coupon payments and the final principal repayment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n1. **Bond Specifications:**\n   - Face value: $1,000\n   - Annual coupon rate: 6% (pays $60 per year)\n   - Years to maturity: 8 years\n   - Current market price: $950\n   - Coupon payments: Annual (at end of each year)\n\n2. **YTM Equation to Solve:**\n   ```\n   Market Price = Σ[Coupon / (1 + YTM)^t] + Face Value / (1 + YTM)^n\n   where t = 1 to n years\n   ```\n\n3. **Implementation Steps:**\n   - Create a function that calculates the present value of all cash flows\n   - Set up equation where PV - Market Price = 0\n   - Use fsolve to find the YTM that makes this equation zero\n   - Verify solution and interpret results\n\n4. **Analysis Questions:**\n   - Is the bond trading at a premium or discount?\n   - How does YTM compare to the coupon rate?\n   - What happens to YTM if the market price increases to $1,050?\n\n**Bonus:** Calculate the bond's duration and modified duration using the YTM you found.",

This is fundamental for many business applications involving simultaneous relationships.\n\n**Mathematical Form:**\n```\nA₁₁x₁ + A₁₂x₂ + ... + A₁ₙxₙ = b₁\nA₂₁x₁ + A₂₂x₂ + ... + A₂ₙxₙ = b₂\n...\nAₘ₁x₁ + Aₘ₂x₂ + ... + Aₘₙxₙ = bₘ\n```\n\n**Key Advantages:**\n- **Exact Solutions:** Unlike optimization, linear systems have precise mathematical solutions\n- **Computational Efficiency:** Highly optimized algorithms for large systems\n- **Numerical Stability:** Robust handling of near-singular matrices\n- **Versatility:** Handles square, overdetermined, and underdetermined systems\n\n**Business Applications:**\n- **Market Equilibrium:** Supply and demand balance across multiple markets\n- **Input-Output Analysis:** Economic relationships between industry sectors\n- **Financial Planning:** Budget allocation with multiple constraints\n- **Network Flow:** Transportation and logistics optimization\n- **Regression Analysis:** Solving normal equations for least squares\n\n**Syntax:**\n```python\nsolution = solve(A, b)  # Solves Ax = b for x\n```",

   "source": "## Exercise: Production Planning Optimization\n\nYour manufacturing company produces three products with different profit margins, resource requirements, and market constraints. Use `scipy.optimize.minimize` to find the optimal production plan.\n\n**Your Task:**\n1. **Products and Constraints:**\n   - Product A: $15 profit, 2 hours labor, 3 units material, max demand 100 units\n   - Product B: $25 profit, 4 hours labor, 2 units material, max demand 80 units  \n   - Product C: $18 profit, 3 hours labor, 4 units material, max demand 120 units\n   - Available: 800 labor hours, 600 units of material per week\n\n2. **Objective:** Maximize total weekly profit\n\n3. **Implementation Steps:**\n   - Define objective function (minimize negative profit)\n   - Create constraint functions for labor, material, and demand limits\n   - Set bounds for production quantities (non-negative)\n   - Solve optimization and interpret results\n\n4. **Analysis Questions:**\n   - Which constraints are binding (fully utilized)?\n   - How would profit change if you had 50 more labor hours?\n   - What's the optimal product mix and why?\n\n**Bonus:** Add a constraint that Product A must be at least 20% of total production.",
