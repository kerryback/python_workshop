## Workshop Materials

Slides and other resources are at https://workshop.kerryback.com 



## Why Python?


- Data analysis
- Automate things 
- Example from MGMT 675: [Cost of Equity App](https://costofequity.koyeb.app/) 
- The app is written entirely in python. 
- [**All of the python code was written by AI.**]{style="color: tomato;"} 

## Plan for the Workshop

- We will work through notebooks together 
- Respond to the Working/Stuck/Ready poll if you get stuck or when you finish a notebook
- When everyone is finished, we will discuss and then move on together to the next notebook
- <span style="color: tomato; font-weight: bold;">Important</span>: Our goal is to learn [what can be done]{style="color: tomato;"} and how python works [in general]{style="color: tomato;"}.  It is [not our goal to remember exactly]{style="color: tomato;"} how to do all of the things we will cover.  
- We can always ask AI to supply the details.
